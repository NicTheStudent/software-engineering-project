# software-engineering-project / REKO-ring

REKO-ring is an app used for buying and selling self-produced or self-refined goods, such as crops, meat or honey. The purpose for this app is to advocate a market for local goods without the need of social media.

## Installation & User Instructions

The project can be run in Visual Studio together with the Xamarin.Forms library. The debug has only been tested on Android emulators. The computer needs to be connected to the internet and allow connections to remote Mongo databases.

 **-** Start the app
 **-** Look around in the app, place orders, choose RekoRing, create offers etc. To be able to create new offers, you have to log in and open a shop, which you can do on the "Mitt Konto" tab.  
 **-** Create a new account, or log in as user 'LucasAndren' with password 'pw', to be able to see "Gamla beställningar" on the "Mitt Konto" tab (these are just orders with dates that have expired, i.e. orders with a date older than the date for the last meeting with the producers).

## GitInspector

Screenshot and original HTML file of Gitinspector is found in the folder named "Gruppdokument". While gitinspector did a good job for 6/7 members, it does for Oscar Grönquist. Likely this is becuase he pushed the original Visual Studio project (we failed to make gitinspector disregard these changes). For a more reasonable account of his contribution check github insights from April 15th.
