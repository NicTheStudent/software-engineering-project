# software-engineering-project / REKO-ring

REKO-ring is an app used for buying and selling self-produced or self-refined goods, such as crops, meat or honey. The purpose for this app is to advocate a market for local goods without the need of social media.

## Installation

The project can be run in Visual Studio together with the Xamarin.Forms library. The debug has only been tested on Android emulators. The computer needs to be connected to the internet and allow connections to remote Mongo databases.

## GitHub Structure

The source code can be found in:
"software-engineering-project/REKO/REKO"

Some classes for the creation of objects to be saved in the database can be found in:
"software-engineering-project/REKO/REKO/classes"

## GitInspector

Screenshot and original HTML file of Gitinspector is found in the folder named "Gruppdokument". Our perception is that the Gitinspector doesn't show an adequate representation of how the contributions actually have looked throughout the course. We would therefor recommend you to compare these numbers to the numbers at the "Insights" tab in the Github repo, as well as the reflections.
