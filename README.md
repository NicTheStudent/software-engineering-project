# software-engineering-project / REKO-ring

REKO-ring is an app used for buying and selling self-produced or self-refined goods, such as crops, meat or honey. The purpose for this app is to advocate a market for local goods without the need of social media.

## Installation

The project can be run in Visual Studio together with the Xamarin.Forms library. The debug has only been tested on Android emulators. The computer needs to be connected to the internet and allow connections to remote Mongo databases.
